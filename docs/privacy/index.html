                    YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUEST RESTRICTIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON HOW WE USE AND/OR DISCLOSE YOUR PHI,

                    YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACCESS, INSPECT AND OBTAIN A COPY OF YOUR PHI, INCLUDING ANY ELECTRONIC PHI;
                    PROVIDED, HOWEVER, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ACCESS CERTAIN PHI EXEMPTED UNDER HIPAA. TO THE EXTENT WE
                    MAINTAIN ELECTRONIC PHI, UPON REQUEST WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH A COPY OF YOUR PHI IN THE FORMAT

                    FEE TO COVER COPY COSTS AND POSTAGE. IN SOME LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY DENY YOUR REQUEST FOR
                    ACCESS TO PHI IN WHICH CASE YOU MAY REQUEST FOR THE DENIAL TO BE REVIEWED. IF ACCESS IS ULTIMATELY
                    DENIED, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A WRITTEN EXPLANATION WITH THE REASON(S) FOR THE DENIAL.
                    YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE AN ACCOUNTING OF DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PHI MADE BY US, INCLUDING
                    DISCLOSURES TO OR BY OUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATE(S), FOR A PERIOD OF SIX (6) YEARS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON
